N.B As I Gregory Oakley-Stevenson only use Kinchbus services most of this code is only tested on the Kinchkard system
However as both systems appear to be running the same software it should work for trentbarton.

If trentbarton/kinchbus/wellglade or anyone else wants to contact me feel free to drop an email gregory@okonetwork.org.uk
If an in person meeting is required for whatever reason I am able to travel across trentbartonland/kinchbus universe :)
